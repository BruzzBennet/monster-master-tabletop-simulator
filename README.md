# Overview

This code is used to make playing the card game "Monster Master" easier
-It automates the Life Point system (which uses cards), to move, draw and add cards by pressing buttons
-It makes drawing 6 cards a more fancy experience
-It makes starting the game feel better, as it automatically adds the impact of showcasing a Master and adding its Life Points

This is done to help me improve one of my passion projects :)
